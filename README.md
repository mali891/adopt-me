# Adopt me

Front-end React application using the Petfinder API. A simple app to consolidate some of the commercial work I've done with React, and to try some different approaches. I haven't focused so much on styling the app (as much as that hurts), but more on the functionality. I'm aware there are lots of UX and UI improvements which could be made.

## Prerequisites

-   You'll need the newest LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). I'm using 10.3.0.
-   You'll also need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed globally.

## Installation

-   `cd` into root
-   run `yarn` or `npm install`

## Run

-   `cd` into root
-   run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` - this will run the app on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)

## Bundler

-   Uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). Quick and easy for small apps.

## Router

-   Uses [Reach Router](https://github.com/reach/router). Top level routes found in `./src/App.js`.

## State management

-   Uses [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). Nice simple way to manage state without relying on third party libraries. Redux has it's place for sure, I didn't want to overengineer this app.

## Tooling

-   Uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to maintain code quality. Keeps everything nice and consistent, especially useful when working in teams.

## More stuff

-   I'll keep tweaking and updating the app as time goes on.
